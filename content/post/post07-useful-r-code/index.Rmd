This is a place where I will save some useful notes and code, to save me having to Google common tasks:

<https://steverxd.github.io/Useful-R-code.html>

So far this includes notes on:

-   basic GitHub operations (e.g. create a new repository)
-   producing plots (ggplot); and
-   working with strings in R (e.g. find and replace text)

I plan to add to these notes over time!
